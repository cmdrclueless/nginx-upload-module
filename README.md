# nginx-upload-module

This is a fork of the `2.2` branch of the
[nginx-upload-module](https://github.com/vkholodkov/nginx-upload-module) that
allows for:

 * Configurable support for `PUT` and `PATCH` HTTP methods
 * Passing `GET` and `OPTIONS` requests transparently on to the `upload_pass`
   handler

## Versioning

*Current Version*: `2.2.1+veracross.1`

Currently this fork is versioned with a `+veracross` build suffix. This
follows the build metadata portion of
[Semantic Versioning specification](http://semver.org/).

## Documentation

The following documentation covers the features this fork adds. The original
documentation should be used for all other functionality:

### upload_pass_other_methods

This flag (`on`/`off`) configures the upload module to pass any requests that
are not `POST`, `PUT` or `PATCH` on to the `upload_pass` location without
processing them at all.

The nginx-upload-module normally responds to `OPTIONS` requests with a
hard-coded `200 OK` response, which does not allow applications to properly
handle cross-domain `OPTIONS` requests.

With this option turned on, your application code will be invoked for `OPTIONS`
requests, and all other methods such as `GET`, `DELETE` and `HEAD`.

```
location /files {
	upload_pass @my_handler;
	upload_pass_other_methods on;
}
```

### upload_allow_methods_put_patch

This flag (`on`/`off`) configures the upload module to allow file upload
handling for the HTTP `PUT` and `PATCH` methods.

The nginx-upload-module normally rejects all requests that do not use `POST`.

```
location /files {
	upload_pass @my_handler;
	upload_allow_methods_put_patch on;
}
```
